### abstract 

This submission presents a novel approach for predicting the peak bloom date of cherry blossoms using an ensemble of weak Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and February external regressors. The method was applied to five locations: Kyoto, Liestal, Washington D.C., New York City, and Vancouver. For the first three locations, a variety of specialty kernels were employed with SVMs using the experimental R package {maize}, which were then stacked to create an ensemble model. These SVMs utilized a carefully selected set of predictors based on February data, including total precipitation, total relative humidity, maximum temperature, carbon levels, year, and an additional variable called "last freeze day." The last freeze day required an additional wavelet SVM for accurate prediction. For New York City and Vancouver, where historical data was limited, a latitude-based ensemble was created using the SVM stacks from the other three locations, with a bias adjustment based on the previous year's bloom date.

### additional framework details

#### zorghum zakura method

The historical weather dataset used in this study was obtained from NASAPOWER, a reliable source for climate data. This dataset was merged with bloom date data spanning from 2001 to 2024, providing a comprehensive foundation for the analysis. The combined dataset was then divided into multiple subsets to facilitate the training of various SVM models.

Nine distinct kernels were employed in training the SVMs: laplacian, hyperbolic tangent, cosine similarity, cauchy, t-student, RBF-ANOVA, tanimoto, wavelet, and fourier. This diverse set of kernels allowed for capturing different patterns and relationships within the data. The training process resulted in over 100 potential SVMs, providing a rich pool of models for stacking.

The stacking method utilized the {stacks} library, which ensembles the top-performing models. Various stacking approaches were tested, including elastic-net and LASSO ensembling techniques. The final member stack was carefully selected to create the most accurate bloom day of year prediction.

One key innovation in this approach was the inclusion of the "last freeze day" as a predictor. Since this day typically occurs in March, a separate SVM with a wavelet kernel was developed to estimate this variable before incorporating it into the member stack. This additional step improved the overall accuracy of the predictions.

To provide a measure of uncertainty, prediction intervals were generated based on the spread of point forecasts within the stack. This approach offers insights into the potential range of bloom dates, accounting for variability in the predictions.

For the 2025 predictions, temperature and humidity data were sourced from openmeteo, as NASAPOWER data is subject to a delay. However, due to significant discrepancies between NASAPOWER-corrected precipitation and openmeteo precipitation data, February 2025 precipitation was predicted using an SVM with a sorensen kernel. This ensured consistency and accuracy in the precipitation input for the model.

#### elote method

To address the challenge of data-poor situations, such as Vancouver and New York City where insufficient historical data was available for training SVMs, an alternative approach called the elote method was developed. This method assumes that these locations can be modeled based on their latitudinal relationship to Washington D.C. and Liestal.

The elote method creates predictions for Vancouver and New York City using a latitude-weighted blend of the ensembled models from Washington D.C. and Liestal. To account for local variations and recent trends, these predictions were then bias-adjusted based on a five-day spread observed in the bloom date for 2024.

It's worth noting that despite its geographical proximity, Kyoto was not included in the elote method due to its distinct weather patterns, which differ significantly from the North American and European locations in the study.

This novel approach, combining SVMs with many kernels & few external regressors is designed as a creative solutions for cherry bloom prediction. Providing a framework of stacking many SVMs, which would typically not be the ideal model of choice for this competition.
